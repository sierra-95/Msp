Certainly! In a typical 7-segment display, each digit is formed by lighting up a combination of seven segments labeled 'a' through 'g'. These segments are arranged in such a way that, when illuminated in specific patterns, they can form different digits from 0 to 9.

Here's a visual representation of a common cathode 7-segment display:


   a
  ---
f|   |b
  ---  
e|   |c
  ---   * g
   d
Each segment corresponds to a particular bit in a binary value, where a set bit (1) indicates that the segment is turned on, and a cleared bit (0) means that the segment is off. The mapping of segments to bits is typically as follows:


     A
  ------
 |      |  <- Bit representation:
F|      |B      0b00001100
 |  G   |      0b10000000
  ------
 |      |  <- Segment representation:
E|      |C      a b c d e f g
 |   D  |
  ------
For example, to display the digit 0, we need to turn on segments 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'f'. In binary, this corresponds to the value 0b00111111.
0b 0011 1111                          
     fe dcba          //abcdef should b high. G=0 . start from RHS to LHS
   a
  ---
f|   |b
  ---  
e|   |c
  ---   * g
   d 
 

Here's the mapping of each digit to its binary representation:


const uint8_t digits[10] = {
    0b00111111, // 0
    0b00000110, // 1
    0b01011011, // 2
    0b01001111, // 3
    0b01100110, // 4
    0b01101101, // 5
    0b01111101, // 6
    0b00000111, // 7
    0b01111111, // 8
    0b01101111  // 9
};
We can form each digit by setting the corresponding bits for the segments 'a' to 'g' to 1 (on) in the binary value. The order of the bits in the binary representation corresponds to the physical connection of the segments on the 7-segment display.

Make sure to check the datasheet of your specific 7-segment display to verify the pinout and segment arrangement. If the segment connections are different from the common cathode display or if you are using a common anode display, the bit patterns would need to be adjusted accordingly to correctly display the desired digits.
